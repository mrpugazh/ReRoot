# 🌱 ReRoot : AI-Driven Reforestation Planner

This project brings **Reforestation through Ecological Restoration** using Optimized Output Technology.


## 🔍 What this project done

It is an AI-powered decision support tool that automates land classification, evaluates ecological suitability, and recommends native tree species for effective reforestation. It combines satellite imagery, environmental datasets, and machine learning to support data-driven ecosystem restoration.

## 📡 Dataset

This model is trained on a dataset available ion UCI repo:  
📂 [Forest cover type Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/31/covertype)



## 🚀 Features

- 🌍 **Satellite Land Classification** using Random Forest (UCI Cover Type Dataset)
- 🌡️ **Environmental Suitability Evaluation** based on elevation, slope, and aspect
- 🌳 **Tree Species Recommendation** via K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- 🗺️ **Supports GIS-compatible Outputs** (future enhancement)
- 🌐 **Streamlit Web Interface Ready** (for deployment)
- 📊 **Accuracy Reporting and Classification Metrics**
